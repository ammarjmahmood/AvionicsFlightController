## Project Overview

This repository contains KiCad PCB designs for avionics flight controllers specifically designed for model rockets. The project aims to develop and deploy over 20 flight controller systems for rocket launches scheduled for May 2026.

Our avionics system consists of a three stack board design:

1. **GPS Board** (Currently Available)
2. **Sensor Board** (Coming Soon)
3. **Power Board** (Coming Soon)

## Current Progress

The GPS board design is now complete and ready for review. This board handles positioning data for the rocket during flight and recovery phases.

## Upcoming Work

Work is ongoing for the sensor and power boards which will complete the Hello Kitty avionics stack:

* **Sensor Board**: Will incorporate accelerometers, gyroscopes, barometers, and other sensors necessary for flight data collection
* **Power Board**: Will manage power distribution, battery management, and charging systems

## Project Timeline

* **2025 Q2**: GPS Board design and testing
* **2025 Q3**: Sensor Board design
* **2025 Q4**: Power Board design
* **2026 Q1**: Integration testing and flight preparation
* **2026 May**: Launch of 20+ rockets with Hello Kitty avionics systems
